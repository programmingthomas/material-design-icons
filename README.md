# Material Design Icons

Material Design Icons are the official open-source [icons](http://www.google.com/design/spec/resources/sticker-sheets.html#sticker-sheets-components) featured in the Google [Material Design](http://www.google.com/design/spec) specification.

## What's included?

* **PDF versions of all icons in both 24px and 48px flavours** - useful for iOS developers using vector icons in Xcode 6
* SVG versions of all icons in both 24px and 48px flavours
* SVG and CSS sprites of all icons
* 1x, 2x icons targeted at the Web (PNG)
* 1x, 2x, 3x icons targeted at iOS (PNG)
* Hi-dpi versions of all icons (hdpi, mdpi, xhdpi, xxhdpi, xxxhdpi) (PNG)

A live [preview](http://google.github.io/material-design-icons/)  of the icon set is available.

## Getting Started

To use the icons in your iOS projects, download the repository and drag the PDF files into Xcode (either 24px or 48px variants) image catalogs. Xcode will then generate the @1x, @2x or @3x assets.

## Structure

### Icons

In general, an icon category (e.g `action`) will include the following directories, containing multiple resolutions of our icons.

* 1x, 2x Web
* 1x, 2x, 3x iOS
* drawable hdpi, mdpi, xhdpi, xxhdpi, xxxhdpi
* svg
* pdf

Decide on the icon resolution required for your project and copy, then reference the icons you wish to use.
